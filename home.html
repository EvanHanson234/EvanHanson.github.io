        <h1> here is the body </h1>
        <p> This is for my Software Engeneering class </p>
        <p> The section that caught my attention was the "Stone Soup 
            and Boiled Frogs" section because I thought that it was 
            a super bizzare title but then it actually was a relatable paragraph
            that I can utilize in my future projects. The story about the soldiers 
            and the vilagers did not seem like it would be something that I would
            be able to relate to my life, but after the section got to its point, 
            I saw the importance of proving you worth before getting everyone's support.</p>
